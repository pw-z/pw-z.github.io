```
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

## Suzanne Vega


### Tom's Diner

>"Tom's Diner" is a song written in 1982 by American singer and songwriter Suzanne Vega. It was first released as a track on the January 1984 issue of Fast Folk Musical Magazine. When first featured on one of her own studio albums, it appeared as the first track of her 1987 album Solitude Standing. It was later used as the basis for a remix by the British group DNA in 1990, which reached number 1 in Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland. The 1991 compilation Tom's Album includes the DNA version as well as cover versions by such artists as After One, Nikki D and Bingo Hand Job (R. E. M. and Billy Bragg). It was also used as the background soundtrack for the opening scene of the 1993 film Untamed Heart.


I am sitting In the morning
At the diner On the corner

I am waiting At the counter
For the man To pour the coffee

And he fills it Only halfway
And before I even argue

He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in

"It is always Nice to see you"
Says the man Behind the counter

To the woman Who has come in
She is shaking Her umbrella

And I look The other way
As they are kissing Their hellos

I'm pretending Not to see them
And Instead I pour the milk

I open Up the paper
There's a story Of an actor

Who had died While he was drinking
He was no one I had heard of

And I'm turning To the horoscope
And looking For the funnies

When I'm feeling Someone watching me
And so I raise my head

There's a woman On the outside
Looking inside Does she see me?

No she does not Really see me
Cause she sees Her own reflection

And I'm trying Not to notice
That she's hitching Up her skirt

And while she's Straightening her stockings
Her hair Is getting wet

Oh, this rain It will continue
Through the morning As I'm listening

To the bells Of the cathedral
I am thinking Of your voice

And of the midnight picnic Once upon a time
Before the rain began

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train
